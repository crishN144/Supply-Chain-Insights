# Supply Chain Insights: Analysis and Optimization

## Project Overview

This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of a company's supply chain using Python. It aims to provide insights for supply chain managers, business analysts, and decision-makers through various analytical approaches.

### What Was Done

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, standardized formats, and prepared the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigated patterns in product types, pricing, and sales performance.
- **Revenue Analysis**: Analyzed the relationship between price and revenue for different product types.
- **Transportation Analysis**: Examined defect rates and costs associated with different transportation modes.
- **Stock and Order Analysis**: Investigated stock levels and order quantities across different SKUs.
- **Shipping Cost Analysis**: Analyzed shipping costs and revenue generation by different carriers.

### Key Findings

- Skincare products generate more revenue as their price increases.
- Road transportation results in higher defect rates, while air transportation has the lowest.
- Carrier B generates the most revenue but also has the highest shipping costs.
- Haircare products have the highest defect rate among all product types.

## Conclusion

This comprehensive analysis of the supply chain has revealed several key insights:

1. **Product Performance**: Skincare products are the top performers in terms of sales and revenue generation, especially at higher price points.

2. **Transportation Impact**: While road transportation is widely used, it results in higher defect rates. Air transportation, despite being costlier, has the lowest defect rates.

3. **Carrier Performance**: Carrier B generates the most revenue but also incurs the highest shipping costs, suggesting a need for efficiency optimization.

4. **Defect Management**: Haircare products show the highest defect rates, indicating a need for quality control improvements in this category.

5. **Inventory Management**: Stock levels and order quantities vary significantly across SKUs, highlighting the importance of efficient inventory management.

These findings provide valuable insights for supply chain managers and decision-makers, offering data-driven guidance for optimizing operations, reducing defects, and improving overall supply chain performance.
